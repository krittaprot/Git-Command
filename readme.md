# Git Commands for Machine Learning Engineers 🚀

Welcome to your comprehensive guide for mastering Git commands essential for Machine Learning Engineers! This repository contains a structured curriculum designed to teach you Git in one day.

## 📚 Learning Path

This curriculum is designed for a full day of learning (6-8 hours) with hands-on practice:

### Morning Session (2-3 hours)
1. **[Git Basics](01-git-basics.md)** - Understanding version control and Git fundamentals
2. **[Repository Setup](02-repository-setup.md)** - Creating and cloning repositories
3. **[Basic Workflow](03-basic-workflow.md)** - Add, commit, push, pull operations

### Midday Session (2-3 hours)
4. **[Branching & Merging](04-branching-merging.md)** - Feature branches and merge strategies
5. **[ML Workflow Integration](05-ml-workflow.md)** - Git for data science and ML projects
6. **[Handling Large Files](06-large-files.md)** - Git LFS for datasets and models

### Afternoon Session (2-3 hours)
7. **[Collaboration](07-collaboration.md)** - Working with teams and code reviews
8. **[Advanced Commands](08-advanced-commands.md)** - Rebase, cherry-pick, and more
9. **[Troubleshooting](09-troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions
10. **[Best Practices](10-best-practices.md)** - ML-specific Git best practices

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this curriculum, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Set up and manage Git repositories for ML projects
- ✅ Use branching strategies for experiment tracking
- ✅ Handle large datasets and model files with Git LFS
- ✅ Collaborate effectively with ML teams
- ✅ Integrate Git with Jupyter notebooks and ML pipelines
- ✅ Troubleshoot common Git issues in ML workflows
- ✅ Follow industry best practices for ML version control

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Basic command line knowledge
- Python and ML fundamentals (helpful but not required)
- A GitHub account (for practice exercises)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-ml-commands.git
   cd git-ml-commands
   ```

2. **Follow the learning path:** Start with `01-git-basics.md` and work through each file sequentially.

3. **Practice as you go:** Each section includes hands-on exercises. Create a separate practice repository to try out the commands.

## 📖 How to Use This Guide

- **Read actively:** Don't just read - try every command
- **Practice immediately:** Set up a test repository and experiment
- **Take notes:** Jot down commands you find most useful
- **Ask questions:** Use GitHub issues to ask questions or suggest improvements

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

Make sure you have Git installed:

```bash
# Check if Git is installed
git --version

# If not installed, visit: https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

Configure your Git identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
